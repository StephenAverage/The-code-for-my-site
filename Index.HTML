   <!--The "Igm" tag is a price of cod to insert a image in a webpage, 
   if you have notice, there's a "src" tag next to "img", the 'src' tag is there to give a image a soruce so we insert it into the webpage
   "Alt" is just text if a user does not want a image to be display or a user has a visual impairment
   "Height" is just way to adjust the height of the image on a side there's also a "weight" which by the name is also way to adjust the image as well, 
   (Thought you'll only need 'height' since the image would just adjust the image for the webpage)-->

   </audio>

   <!---The "audio" inserts a MP3 player into your webpage,
   'controls' next door to the "audio" is a player
   Now, we simply can't put audio in your webpage code and expect it to play the music, no!
   That would be a silly goose, we give it a soruce of where the audio is coming from, to do that
   just type "enter" and type "source src" under the 'audio' tag and give the 'sec=' the msuic of your choice

   (If a browser doesn't suppoert MPG4 formet which I don't know it won't since all broswer
   support MPG4 but just in case, type "type" to adjust the type for a formet and type "wav" if that certain browser
   only support "Wave" formet)
   
   'autoplay' feature code is a function to autoplay audio once every time a user enter the webpage or refresh the page
   (However you shouldn't that feature because it's a quite nuisance to have fucking music blasting though your ears every time you click on a page
   to counter that, you can simply to have the audio loop once by using the function called "muted" that way; the audio will loop once without the audio being unmuted
   
   If you to tortute someone through the endless suffering of music than you can continuously
   code a function to let it loop forver until a user paused it by
   added a "loop" to the function ) 
   (Now, if you want to kill your users, I hope sure not and you are a decent person,
   I sure hope you are because you add a "muted" function next to the 'loop' which will muted the loop autoplay.)-->

   Note: The "Video" tag is a way to add a video to your webpage
   added "src" next to your "video" is a pathway to id the video you want to be in your webpage
   if a broswer didn't support MPG4 (Which they all do but just in case)
   you can add "type=" and type the video format you like to use like example
   "webm" it should look like something like this "type"="video/mp4"-->
